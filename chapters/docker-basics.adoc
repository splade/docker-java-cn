## Docker Basics Docker基础

*PURPOSE目的*: This chapter introduces the basic terminology of Docker. 本章介绍Docker的基本术语。

[quote, docs.docker.com/]
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.Docker是一为开发者和系统管理员提供开发、交付、运行应用程序的平台。Docker让你快速的从组件中打包应用和消除交付代码时冲突。Docker让你的代码尽可能快的被测试和部署。

Docker simplifies software delivery by making it easy to build and share images that contain your application’s entire environment, or _application operating system_.Docker通过很容易的构建和分享镜像简化了软件的交付。Docker镜像中包含你的应用程序的完整的环境或_应用程序操作系统_。

**What does it mean by an application operating system ?**

Your application typically require a specific version of operating system, application server, JDK, database server, may require to tune the configuration files, and similarly multiple other dependencies. The application may need binding to specific ports and certain amount of memory. The components and configuration together required to run your application is what is referred to as application operating system.

You can certainly provide an installation script that will download and install these components. Docker simplifies this process by allowing to create an image that contains your application and infrastructure together, managed as one component. These images are then used to create Docker containers which run on the container virtualization platform, provided by Docker.

**Main Components of Docker**

Docker has three main components:

. __Images__ are *build component* of Docker and a read-only template of application operating system.__镜像__是Docker的*构建组件*，是应用操作系统只读的模板。
. __Containers__ are *run component* of Docker, and created from, images.Containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted.__容器__ 是Docker的*运行组件*, 由镜像创建。容器可以运行、启动、停止、移动、删除.
. Images are stored, shared, and managed in a __registry__, the *distribution component* of Docker. The publically available registry is known as Docker Hub (available at http://hub.docker.com). 镜像在一个__注册表__中存储，分享，管理，是Docker的*分发成分*。公共可以获得的注册表被称作Docker Hub（ http://hub.docker.com )。

In order for these three components to work together, there is *Docker Daemon* that runs on a host machine and does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing Docker containers. In addition, there is *Client* that is a Docker binary which accepts commands from the user and communicates back and forth with the daemon.

Client communicates with Daemon, either co-located on the same host, or on a different host. It requests the Daemon to pull an image from the repository using `pull` command. The Daemon then downloads the image from Docker Hub, or whatever registry is configured. Multiple images can be downloaded from the registry and installed on Daemon host. Images are run using `run` command to create containers on demand. 客服端和后台服务进程通信，要么两者在同一个主机上，要么在不同的主机上。它请求守护进程从仓库中拉去一个镜像，使用 `pull` 命令。守护进程然后从Docker Hub上下载镜像，获取任意配置好的注册表中。可以从注册表中下载多个镜像，安装在守护进程主机中。可以根据需要使用 `run` 命令运行镜像来创建一个容器。

**How does a Docker Image work? Docker镜像是如何工作的**

We've already seen that Docker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are launched. Each image consists of a series of layers. Docker makes use of union file systems to combine these layers into a single image. Union file systems allow files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system. 我们已经知道了Docker镜像是只读的模板，Docker容器从镜像启动。联合文件系统不同的文件系统，也叫这分支，的文件和目录可以透明的重叠，形成单一的一致的文件系统。

One of the reasons Docker is so lightweight is because of these layers. When you change a Docker image—for example, update an application to a new version— a new layer gets built. Thus, rather than replacing the whole image or entirely rebuilding, as you may do with a virtual machine, only that layer is added or updated. Now you don't need to distribute a whole new image, just the update, making distributing Docker images faster and simpler.Docker如此轻量的一个原因是这些层。当你更改了一个Docker镜像，例如，更新了一个应用到新版本，一个新的层会被构建。因此，不是替换整个镜像，或者像使用虚拟机那样重新构建镜像，仅那一层被更新或者添加。现在，你不需要分发整个新的镜像，仅分发更新，这使得分发Docker镜像更快，更简单。

Every image starts from a base image, for example `ubuntu`, a base Ubuntu image, or `fedora`, a base Fedora image. You can also use images of your own as the basis for a new image, for example if you have a base Apache image you could use this as the base of all your web application images.每个镜像都是从一个基础镜像开始构建的，比如 `ubuntu`，一个基础的Ubuntu镜像。你可以你自己的镜像作为新镜像的基础镜像，例如，如果你有Apache基础镜像，你可以使用这个镜像作为所有的网站应用的基础镜像。

NOTE: By default, Docker obtains these base images from Docker Hub. 默认，Docker从Docker Hub中获得这个镜像。

Docker images are then built from these base images using a simple, descriptive set of steps we call instructions. Each instruction creates a new layer in our image. Instructions include actions like: 然后使用简单的，描述性的步骤，我们称为指令从这些基础镜像中构建Docker镜像。每一个指令在我们的镜像中创建一个新的层。指令包含动作像这个样：

. Run a command 运行一个命令
. Add a file or directory 添加一个文件或者目录
. Create an environment variable 创建一个环境变量
. Run a process when launching a container 当启动时运行一个进程

These instructions are stored in a file called a Dockerfile. Docker reads this Dockerfile when you request a build of an image, executes the instructions, and returns a final image.保存这些指令的文件成为Dockerfile文件。Docker读这个Dockerfile当你请求构建一个镜像时，执行里面的指令，返回最终的一个镜像。

**How does a Container work?容器是如何工作的**

A container consists of an operating system, user-added files, and meta-data. As we've seen, each container is built from an image. That image tells Docker what the container holds, what process to run when the container is launched, and a variety of other configuration data. The Docker image is read-only. When Docker runs a container from an image, it adds a read-write layer on top of the image (using a union file system as we saw earlier) in which your application can then run.一个容器由操作系统，用户添加的文件，或者元数据。正如我们所见，每一个容器是从镜像构建的。镜像高斯Docker,容器中包含有什么，当容器启动时运行那个进程，各种其它的配置数据。Docker镜像是只读的，当Docker从一个镜像中运行容器时，它在镜像上面增加了一个读写层（使用联合文件系统，正如我们在前面所见），在那个层中，你的应用程序可以运行。

### Docker Machine Docker Machine

Machine makes it really easy to create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them. Machine使得很容易在你的主机上, 在云提供商，在你的数据中心上创建Docker。它创建服务器，在它们上面安装Docker,然后配置Docker客户端和它们通信。

Once your Docker host has been created, it then has a number of commands for managing containers:

. Start, stop, restart container
. Upgrade Docker
. Configure the Docker client to talk to a host

You used Docker Machine already during the attendee setup. We won't need it too much further on. But if you need to create hosts, it's a very handy tool to know about. From now on we're mostly going to use the docker client.

Find out more about the details at the link:https://docs.docker.com/machine/[Docker Machine Website].

Check if docker machine is working:

  docker-machine -v

It shows the output similar to the one shown below:

  docker-machine version 0.4.1 (e2c88d6)

NOTE: The exact version may differ based upon how recently the installation was performed.

### Docker Client

The client communicates with the demon process on your host and let's you work with images and containers.

Check if your client is working using the following command:

  docker -v

It shows the output similar to the following:

  Docker version 1.8.2, build 0a8c2e3

NOTE: The exact version may differ based upon how recently the installation was performed.

The most important options you'll be using frequently are:

. `run` - runs a container
. `ps`- lists containers
. `stop` - stops a container
. `rm` - Removes a container

Get a full list of available commands with

  docker

A more comprehensive list of commands is also available in <<Common_Docker_Commands>>.

### Verify Docker Configuration

Check if your Docker Host is running:

  docker-machine ls

You should see the output similar to:

[source, text]
----
NAME        ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM
lab                  virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376   
----

This machine is shown in "`Running`" state. If the machine state is stopped, start it with:

  docker-machine start lab

After it is started you can find out IP address of your Docker Host with:

  docker-machine ip lab

We already did this during the setup document, remember? So, this is a good chance to check, if you already added this IP to your hosts file.

Type:

  ping dockerhost

and see if this resolves to the IP address that the docker-machine command printed out. You should see an output as:

[source, text]
----
> ping dockerhost
PING dockerhost (192.168.99.101): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.99.101: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.394 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.99.101: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.387 ms
----

If it does, you're ready to start with the lab.
